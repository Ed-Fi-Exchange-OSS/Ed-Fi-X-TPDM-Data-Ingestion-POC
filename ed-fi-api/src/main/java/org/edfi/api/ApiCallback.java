/**
 * Ed-Fi Operational Data Store API
 * The Ed-Fi ODS / API enables applications to read and write education data stored in an Ed-Fi ODS through a secure REST interface. The Ed-Fi ODS / API supports both transactional and bulk modes of operation.  ***  > *Note: Consumers of ODS / API information should sanitize all data for display and storage. The ODS / API provides reasonable safeguards against cross-site scripting attacks and other malicious content, but the platform does not and cannot guarantee that the data it contains is free of all potentially harmful content.*  ***
